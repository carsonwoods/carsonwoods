### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carson Woods (he/him). I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at Emory University. 
Previously, I was a computer science researcher working on high-performance computing (HPC). Specifically, my areas of focus included performant communication and system software. 

Occasionally I write [something on my blog and website](https://carsonwoods.io).
