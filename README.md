### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carson Woods (he/him). I'm a computer science researcher at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. 
By day I work on high-performance computing (HPC) research with a focus on research/data provenance and system software. 
By night I work on [answer-set programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming). 

Occasionally I write [something on my blog](https://carsonwoods.io).
